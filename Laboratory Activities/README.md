# LABORATORY ACTIVITY 1 : INTRODUCTION to PYTHON
# Song Details
OVERVIEW <br>
- The first activity, Song details, is a simple Python program that creates a collection and     display the details of the song informations. The program gathers input such as year when the song realesed, genre, album name, song title, and artist name from the user. These details are then display in a well organized format to demonstrate basic programming. <br>

PURPOSE <br>
This activity helps to practice basic python programming concepts like <br>
- Getting inputs from the user.
- Printing formatted output.
- Using variables.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWRS
1. Run the program
2. Enter the Song datails that the program ask
3. Review the output and verify if the details are printed correctly
4. Test different values to see if the programs work correctly


# Character with Greater Value
OVERVIEW
 - The second activity is the character with greater value, this python programs takes two characters as input from the user. The two input character will be compared by their ASCII values and determine which character has the greater value. This program will also display the ASCII values of both characters.

PURPOSE <br>
This activity helps to practice: <br>
- The use of .split() which helps to split a string based on whitespace.
- The use of max which is used to determine the largest value.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Run the program
2. Input two charactes thare separeted with space
3. Review the output and verify if the values are printed correctly
4. Test different values to see if the programs work correctly 

# LABORATORY ACTIVITY 2 : LIBRARIES and CONTROL FLOW
# Palindrome
OVERVIEW
- This python program checks the input integer by the user whether palindrome or not. A plaindrome is a a number that can be read forward and backward with the same values.

PURPOSE <br>
This activity helps to practice: <br>
- The use of slicing that is used for reversing a string.
- Compare the original and reversed values to determine if they are the same.
- Use conditional statements (if-else) to make decisions in a program.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWERS
1. Run the program
2. Input integeres
3. Review the output and check if the integer is palindrome or not

 # Calculate Discount
 OVERVIEW <br>
 -This program calculates a discount based on the purchase amount. If the total purchase amount exceeds 5000, a 10% discount is applied. Otherwise, a 5% discount is given. The program also allows the user to repeat the process if they wish.

PURPOSE <br>
This activity helps to practice: <br>
- To demonstrate how to calculate discounts using basic arithmetic operations.
- To use conditional statements which is the if-else statement to apply different discount rates.
- To show function recursion or the repeatition of he function based on user input.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWERS
1. Run the program
2. Input the purchase amount
3. Review the discount and check if it is the correct discount
4. You will be asked if you want to try again, type yes if you want to calculate again and no to end the program

 # LABORATORY ACTIVITY 3 : DICTIONARIES and LISTS
 # Roman to Integer
 OVERVIEW <br>
 - This program converts the input roman numeral into an integer value.

PURPOSE <br>
This activity helps to practice: <br>
- the use of dictionaries on how to map values.

 INSTRUCTIONS
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a valid Roman numeral
3. The program will display the corresponding integer value
4. Review the ouput and check if the integer value are correct

# Perfect Number
OVERVIEW <br>
- This program checks whether a given number is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

PURPOSE <br>
This activity helps to practice: <br>
- The use of loops and conditional statements to find divisors.
- The use of list comprehensions for efficient calculations.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWERS
1. Run the program
2. Enter a number
3. The program displays the result
4. Review the ouput and check if it is perfect number or not

# LABORATORY ACTIVITY 4 : PYTHON OOPs
# Capybara
OVERVIEW <br>
- This program defines a Capybara class to represent capybaras with attributes like name, gender, and age. It then allows the user to select a test case from the predefined capybara objects and displays the details of the chosen capybara.

PURPOSE <br>
The main goals of this program are:
- To demonstrate the creation of a class with an initializer (__init__) to set attributes.
- To show how to store objects in a dictionary for easy retrieval.
- To allow users to interact with the program and retrieve data dynamically.
- To practice handling user input and retrieving values safely using the get() method.

INSTRUCTIONS
1. Run the program
2. Enter a valid test case number (1 or 2)
3. The program will print the capybara's name, gender, and age.

# Exception Handling
OVERVIEW <br>
- This program allows the user to create an array of floating-point numbers, input the array size and its elements, and print a specific array element based on the given index. It also includes error handling to manage invalid inputs and index out-of-range errors gracefully.

PURPOSE <br>
This activity helps to practice: <br>
- Working with arrays or creating list based on the user input.
- Implementing exception handling wuth the use of try-except

INSTRUCTIONS FOR REVIEWERS
1. Run the program
2. Enter the size of the array
3. Enter the elements of the array
4. Input the index of the element you want to print
5. The program will print the element if the index is valid and show an error message if the index is out of range or if the input is invalid.
